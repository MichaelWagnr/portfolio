            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>2017, while working as a production manager for a food distributer, our 3rd party backend software was retired.</p>

            <p>Two Python developers were brought in to work on a replacement, during which time, managers were given read-only database access and a handful of helpful queries to copy/paste.</p>

            <p>I spent a weekend deepdiving SQL tutorials, inspired by our CEO who taught himself SQL in order to better parse the raw data.</p>

            <p>I began writing client, order and inventory queries for other middle managers.</p>

            <p>Soon after, I continued my self-study with Python - the language our software was being rebuilt in.</p>

            <p>2020 - present, after relocating to Montreal, I shifted my focus towards web development. Pulling in as much information as I can on CSS, Javascript and React.</p>
