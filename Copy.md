//Intro: 

Good afternoon/evening/morning. My Name is Michael. I'm a self-taught Web Developer.

<!-- My story begins when I was 5 years old. My father won an internet router in a raffle at a University of Saskatoon science exhibit. -->

I've been fascinated with computers, software and the internet for as long as I can remember. 

<!-- My family won an internet router through a raffle held by the University of Saskatchewan when I was very young. -->

I've had the privilege to watch the internet evolve for most of my life. From browsing with Netscape and making geocities/angelfire pages to early flash animations and online games. 

<!-- In 2017, A small team of developers were hired into the company I worked for to build replacement backend. The UIs and Dashboards for middle management were low-priority and    -->

My introduction to development started in 2017. Where I worked at the time, a small team of developers were hired to build a replacement backend to our website. A lot of tooling was in production and as a midterm solution, management was given read only permission to the database and textfiles of bespoke SQL queries to parse client and order data. 

Running into some roadblocks. I took it upon myself to learn SQL over the course of a weekend. It was inspiring to watch the inhouse developers create automated solutions.

//Techstack.

Frequently using Git, HTML/JSX, CSS, Vanilla Javascript and React.

Currently exploring design systems and libraries (Sass, Bootstrap, MUI etc.).

Starting to learn Typescript, MongoDB and various extensions of React (Next.js and Redux).

I have a fascination with learning new things and scouring technical manuals and am ready for the dense world of web development - the future is bright.
